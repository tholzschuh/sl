        <p>I'm a master's student majoring in mathematics at Heidelberg University.</p>
    <p>Currently, I'm working on my master's thesis under <a href="https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~schmidt/">Prof. Alexander Schmidt</a> related to a reformulation of Grothendieck's Section Conjecture in terms of étale homotopy types as a homotopy fixed-point problem.</p>
    
    <p>Before that, I was visiting Koyto for about a year as a research student at RIMS, where my advisor was <a href="http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~motizuki/top-english.html">Prof. Shinichi Mochizuki</a>.</p>
    
    <p>I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Heidelberg University at 30/08/2019, where my undergraduate thesis was supervised by <a href="https://typo.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/arith-geom/home/members/gebhard-boeckle/">Prof. Gebhard Böckle</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>## mathematical interests</h3>
    <p>I'm mainly interested in mathematics related to algebraic/arithmetic geometry, although I've not yet decided what exact field I want to specialize in.</p>
    
    <p>Currently I am very interested in mathematics surrounding Grothendieck's Anabelian Conjectures and homotopical methods (especially possible applications of ∞-category theory) in arithmetic geometry in general.</p>
</article>
    
    <p>At RIMS, I focused on studying foundational material needed everywhere throughout arithmetic geometry, i.e. étale cohomology, étale fundamental groups, et cetera and I started studying well-known results regarding Anabelian Geometry.</p>
    
    <h3>## other interests</h3>
    <p>Besides mathematics, I also enjoy consuming lots of different kinds of music and literature and to go hiking.</p>
    <p>I occasionally play a game of go and sometimes even spend time on developing useless <a href="https://github.com/tholzschuh">software</a>, mainly written in the functional programming language <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">haskell</a>.</p>
